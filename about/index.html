	<h4>Hi. </h4>
	<p>The <em>Theatre Of My Mind</em> first launched in the early 1990s as a weblog built on Moveable Type when my wife and I lived in the Bay Area. After a run of nearly a decade I retired the blog when I was trying to purge most of my online presence after a troubling experience as a juror on a murder trial in Moline, Illinois. As you might imagine, a highly personal, opinionated blog with an obvious metropolitan and progressive bias met with some derision in a small town in the Quad Cities. My jury service was both enlightening and frustrating, and while it might have been helpful to have a place to journal publicly about that experience, at the time I felt it was best to simply hunker down and let the clouds blow over. One of the future posts on this new iteration of the <em>Theatre</em> may be a revisitation of my jury experience. (The intervening decade has given time for the situation to cool.)</p>
	<p>My other hope for this blog is that it might become a place for exploration of my thoughts on the state of education in the US. In the decade since that jury trial (which I consider a turning point in my life &mdash; for better or worse) I worked for a couple of years as a middle school special education teacher. Teaching middle school aged children also shaped me in unexpected ways, and I hope to unpack some of that in this space.</p>
	<p>Thank you for visiting. If you have feedback, don't hesitate to reach out.</p>
